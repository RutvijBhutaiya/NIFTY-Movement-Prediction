### Approach

### Data Mining



### Feature Analysis

We did some intresting feature analysis with the help of Tableau. 

#### FII & DII flows and Nifty Change

In the following chart, we have shown theFII (Foreign Institutional Investments) and DII (Domestic InstitutionalInvestments) net flows in quarterly bases since Q1 2008. Green line mentioned in a chart indicatedthe change in Nifty. 

Generally, when FII buys, DII sells and vice versa.  Plus, we can also notice thatwhen FII sells, NIFTY returns are negative and vice versa. Also, we can saythat FIIs have more influence on NIFTY than DIIs. 

However, Q2 2009 there is sharp hick inNIFTY returns because index gave -23.6% in Q1 2009. Also, this time isconsidered as the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) started with real estate crash inthe US. 

Another contradiction noted in Q1 2020,and this event is lockdown lead by COVID19. In next quarter DIIs net purchasewas more than Rs. 72,000 cr, which pulled NIFTY up. And in the following quartersFIIs were back with net positive purchase which let the NIFTY to reach an all timehigh mark.

#### Tree Chart, Day wise change in NIFTY

This is an interesting chart of NIFTY returnsbased on day for selected period. We have noticed that Date 29th ofevery month is registered as the highest return earner of the day, which is alsoone of the highest counts in the selected period. 

Similarly, 24th is the leaseprofit making day if any did intraday trading for the day for long positions.

#### Forex (USD:INR) Change with FII and NIFTY

In the following chart we tried to presentthe relationship between Forex change and FII flows. Because, when INRappreciates, means risk-free returns for the FIIs and vice versa. For e.g.here, INR appreciates mean INR 70 -> INR 65 with respect to USD. 

Now, as we see Year 2011, INR depreciatedby 22.62% and FII flows were also net negative following with negative returnson NIFTY. 

In macroeconomics, Investors arecomfortable with INR depreciation as we can notice 2012, 2014, 2019, 2020.These years also had low volatility in FX change compared to 2013, 2015 and2017. Hence, high change in FX rate either way is not a concern for foreigninvestors, on the other hand, steady change / small directional change can bemore comfortable for foreign investors to take strategic positions.

#### Rank Chart

Following rank chart indicatesrank (% wise returns ) on NIFTY, Oil, Gsec bond and Currency. 

Here, NIFTY (Green Line) and GsecBond (Light Green Line) higher rank means positive portfolio returns. Gsec Bondgenerally considered as Risk free rate of return and Banks Fixed Deposit ratesoften correlated to it. 

For FX (Yellow Line) and Oil (RedLine) - except Year 2017 – has seen negative correlation. This is considered normal, because as Oil prices increase (India’s major Import item) FX comesunder stress, and this leads to outflow of high USD. And outflow of USD makes the INR weak.
